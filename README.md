# AAS-UPB-WT2023
Automatic Algorithm Selection (AAS)

Our task was to recreate the AAS experiments as described in the paper by Kerschke,2019 and Prager,22. This repository contains the code files needed to perform AAS as described. Following are the instructions for running the repository:

-You need to use pip to install all the packages from the requirements.txt file.
-For cocoex, you need to follow the instructions described on thier github repository. (https://github.com/numbbo/coco)
-Once all the packages are installed, you can run the features.py file to create all the feature sets for normalized and unnormalized functions. This is important because the models we need to train require the csv files created using this code.
-After this, you should be able to run all of the models from their individual files
